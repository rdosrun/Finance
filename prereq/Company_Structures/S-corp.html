        <h1>S Corporation (S Corp)</h1>
        <p>An S Corporation is a special type of corporation that avoids double taxation by passing income directly to shareholders, like a partnership or LLC. It retains the liability protection of a C Corp but comes with strict ownership and filing requirements. Only U.S. citizens and certain trusts or estates can be shareholders, and thereâ€™s a cap on the number of shareholders.</p>
        
        <h2>Pros:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pass-through taxation (no corporate-level tax)</li>
            <li>Limited liability protection</li>
            <li>Perpetual existence</li>
            <li>Can pay owners a salary + distributions (potential tax advantages)</li>
            <li>More credibility with investors and lenders</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cons:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Strict ownership limits (max 100 shareholders, all must be U.S. citizens or residents)</li>
            <li>One class of stock only</li>
            <li>More paperwork and compliance than LLCs</li>
            <li>Must follow specific IRS rules or risk losing S Corp status</li>
            <li>Not ideal for businesses seeking venture capital</li>
        </ul>
