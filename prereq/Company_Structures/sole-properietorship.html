        <h1>Sole Proprietorship</h1>
        <p>Sole proprietorship is the most common type of business. This kind of business is owned and operated almost exclusively by one individual. The major drawback of this kind of business is that it doesn’t provide any protection to the individual’s other assets such as real estate, retirement, etc., from liabilities such as debts.</p>
