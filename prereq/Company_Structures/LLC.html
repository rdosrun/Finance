        <h1>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</h1>
        <p>A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a flexible business structure that blends features of both partnerships and corporations. It protects its owners (called members) from personal liability for business debts, while offering pass-through taxation like a sole proprietorship or partnership. LLCs can be owned by individuals, other companies, or even foreign entities. Theyâ€™re popular for their simplicity, liability protection, and tax flexibility.</p>
