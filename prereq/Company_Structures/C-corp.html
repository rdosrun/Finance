        <h1>C Corporation (C Corp)</h1>
        <p>A C Corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its owners (shareholders). It can raise capital by issuing shares and offers the strongest protection from personal liability. C Corps are ideal for businesses planning to grow large, seek outside investment, or go public. However, they are subject to double taxation: once at the corporate level and again when dividends are distributed to shareholders.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Limited liability for shareholders</li>
            <li>Unlimited potential for raising capital (can issue multiple classes of stock)</li>
            <li>Perpetual existence (doesnâ€™t end if an owner leaves or dies)</li>
            <li>Attracts investors more easily</li>
            <li>Well-established legal structure</li>
        </ul>
