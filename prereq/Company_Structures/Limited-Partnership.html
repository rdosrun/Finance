        <h1>Limited Partnership (LP)</h1>
        <p>A limited partnership consists of at least one general partner and one or more limited partners. The general partner manages the business and has unlimited liability, while limited partners contribute capital and have liability only up to their investment. Limited partners typically donâ€™t participate in day-to-day operations.</p>

            <li>Pass-through taxation (no double taxation)</li>
            <li>Flexible profit sharing options</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cons:</h2>

            <li>Legal formalities and documentation required</li>
        </ul>
