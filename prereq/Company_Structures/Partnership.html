        <h1>Partnership</h1>
        <p>A partnership is a business structure where two or more individuals share ownership and operate the business together. All partners typically contribute to the business financially or through labor, and they share profits and losses according to a partnership agreement. This structure allows for shared responsibilities and resources but also means shared liability for debts and legal actions.</p>
